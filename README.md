# Intrusion Detection System using ML & DL

# Abstract

The increasing prevalence of security breaches and malicious software attacks is a major concern in the digital landscape, sparking continued interest in malware detection. Malware attacks significantly impact computer users, networks, businesses, organizations, and governments. Despite the development of multiple intrusion detection systems aimed at protecting data and resources from attacks, the frequent emergence of new threats and attacks poses challenges for these systems to detect and prevent them from penetrating the network.

One such attack is Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which can cause significant damage to computer networks and organizations. To handle these attacks, this study has developed an APT detection system utilizing various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers. These models extract data features from vast amounts of complex data, understanding patterns to detect anomalies and potential threats. This study compares and evaluates their performance on the NSL-KDD dataset. By analyzing various evaluation metrics, it was found that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is the most effective model among all, followed by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
